<p>For almost three months, Internet-of-things botnets built by software called Mirai have been a driving force behind a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/why-the-silencing-of-krebsonsecurity-opens-a-troubling-chapter-for-the-net/">new breed of attacks</a> so powerful they threaten the Internet as we know it. Now, a new botnet is emerging that could soon magnify or even rival that threat.</p>
<p>The as-yet unnamed botnet was first detected on November 23, the day before the US Thanksgiving holiday. For exactly 8.5 hours, it delivered a non-stop stream of junk traffic to undisclosed targets, according to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-daily-ddos-ten-days-of-massive-attacks/">this post published Friday</a> by content delivery network CloudFlare. Every day for the next six days at roughly the same time, the same network pumped out an almost identical barrage, which is aimed at a small number of targets mostly on the US West Coast. More recently, the attacks have run for 24 hours at a time.</p>
<p>While the new distributed denial-of-service attacks aren't as powerful as some of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/">record-setting ones that Mirai participated in</a>, they remain plenty big, especially for an upstart botnet. Peak volumes have reached 400 gigabits per second and 200 million packets per second. The attacks zero in on <a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_NetworkLayerLayer3.htm">layer 3</a> and <a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TransportLayerLayer4.htm">layer 4</a> of a target's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">network layer</a> and are aimed at exhausting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">transmission control protocol</a> resources.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission has reached a preliminary conclusion that AT&amp;T is violating net neutrality rules by using data cap exemptions to favor DirecTV video on its mobile network.</p>
<p>The FCC yesterday also expressed concerns to Verizon about that carrier's similar data cap exemption policies, but the examination of Verizon is in a slightly earlier stage.</p>
<p>The FCC first raised the issue with AT&amp;T a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/att-zero-rating-of-directv-data-may-violate-net-neutrality-fcc-says/">few weeks ago</a>, and AT&amp;T defended its practices in a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/att-defends-directvs-data-cap-exemption-in-net-neutrality-case/">response</a>. But rather than satisfying the commission's concerns, AT&amp;T's response "tends to confirm our initial view that the Sponsored Data program strongly favors AT&amp;T's own video offerings while unreasonably discriminating against unaffiliated edge providers and limiting their ability to offer competing video services to AT&amp;T's broadband subscribers on a level playing field," said a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Letter-to-R.-Quinn-12.1.16.pdf">letter to AT&amp;T</a> yesterday from Jon Wilkins, chief of the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau.</p>

<p>For at least the past six months, a popular remote management app available in the official Google Play Store has opened tens of millions of Android users to code-execution and data-theft attacks when they use unsecured networks, researchers said Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid">AirDroid</a>, which has been downloaded 10 million to 50 million times from the official Google Play Store, uses a static and easily detectable encryption key when transmitting update files and sensitive user data, according to a <a href="https://blog.zimperium.com/analysis-of-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-airdroid/">blog post published by security firm Zimperium</a>. Attackers who are on the same network can exploit the weakness to push fraudulent updates or view potentially sensitive user information, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imei">international mobile equipment identity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Subscriber_Identity">international mobile subscriber identity</a> designations that are unique to each phone.</p>
<p>"A malicious party on the same network as the victim can leverage this vulnerability to remotely gain full control of their device," Simone Margaritelli, principal security researcher at Zimperium's zLabs, told Ars. "Moreover, the attacker will be able to see the user's sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI, and so forth. As soon as the update, or fake update, is installed the software automatically launches the updated [Android app file] without ever verifying who built it."</p>

<figure class="intro-image intro-left"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/satya-nadella-casual-640x413.jpg"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. (credit: Microsoft)</p>  </figure><div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>At its annual shareholder meeting yesterday, some Microsoft shareholders were more than a little concerned about the company's mobile strategy, or if it even had one, reports <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2016/wielding-windows-phones-microsoft-shareholders-grill-ceo-satya-nadella-device-strategy/">GeekWire</a>.</p>
<p>The meeting, which started with a request to "silence all Windows Phones and devices," gives the company's owners a rare opportunity to grill CEO Satya Nadella, and among the audience were some dedicated Windows Phone fans. One such Windows Phone-using shareholder, Dana Vance, expressed his surprise that Microsoft had released apps such as its Pix photo app and Outlook apps for Android and iPhone, but not its own platform. Vance is also an owner of the Band fitness wearable, and he alluded to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/microsoft-disbands-the-band-fitness-device-pulled-from-stores-no-band-3-this-year/">claims</a> that development of the device has been halted. With Microsoft appearing to downplay these two consumer-facing devices, he asked Nadella to explain the company's plans for consumer devices.</p>
<p>In response, Nadella gave the same kind of reply as he's given a number of times; the kind of reply that arguably prompted these questions in the first place. "When we control things silicon-up, that's how we will integrate those experiences," Nadella said. Microsoft will "build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it—whether it's Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone—and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That's what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation." Per Geekwire, Nadella did also say that the Windows camera and mail apps would include features found in the apps for other platforms, but it's not clear when this will happen, or whether Microsoft's Windows apps will persistently trail behind its non-Windows apps.</p>

<p>A new variant of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/shamoon-malware-attack/">Shamoon</a>, the malware that wiped hard drives at Saudi Aramco and other energy companies in 2012, has struck multiple organizations in Saudi Arabia in a new campaign that researchers call a "carefully planned operation." The new variant, which is almost identical to the version used in the 2012 attacks, has replaced the message it previously displayed—which included an image of a burning American flag—with the photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian refugee boy who drowned as his family tried to cross from Turkey to Greece.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-01/destructive-hacks-strike-saudi-arabia-posing-challenge-to-trump">Bloomberg reports</a> that digital forensics by Saudi officials indicated that the attacks were launched from Iran. Several Saudi government agencies were among the organizations attacked.</p>
<p>New versions of Shamoon, also known as Disttrack, have been detected by multiple information security companies, including <a href="https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/shamoon-rebooted/">McAfee</a>, Symantec, <a href="http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/">Palo Alto Networks</a>, and FireEye. It isn't yet clear how the malware's "dropper" has gotten into the networks it has attacked. But once on a victim's Windows system, it determines whether to install a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the malware. According to a <a href="https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever">report from Symantec</a>, the latest Shamoon attack was configured to automatically start wiping the disk drives of computers it had infected at 8:45am local time on November 17.</p>

<p>Developers with both Mozilla and Tor have published browser updates that patch a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/firefox-0day-used-against-tor-users-almost-identical-to-one-fbi-used-in-2013/">critical Firefox vulnerability being actively exploited</a> to deanonymize people using the privacy service.</p>
<p>"The security flaw responsible for this urgent release is already actively exploited on Windows systems," a Tor official wrote in an <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-607-released">advisory published Wednesday afternoon</a>. "Even though there is currently, to the best of our knowledge, no similar exploit for OS X or Linux users available, the underlying bug affects those platforms as well. Thus we strongly recommend that all users apply the update to their Tor Browser immediately."</p>
<p>The Tor browser is based on the open-source Firefox browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Shortly after this post went live, Mozilla security official Daniel Veditz published a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/11/30/fixing-an-svg-animation-vulnerability/">blog post</a> that said the vulnerability has also been fixed in a just-released version of Firefox for mainstream users. On early Wednesday, Veditz said, his team received a copy of the attack code that exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in Firefox.</p>

<p>Altice USA, which recently became the country's fourth largest cable company by purchasing Cablevision and Suddenlink, today <a href="http://altice.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Altice-pr-altice-USA-Unveils-Generation-Gigaspeed.pdf">announced</a> a big project to replace cable with fiber-to-the-home technology. Altice said it intends to "deliver broadband speeds of up to 10 Gbps across its footprint."</p>
<p>Based in the Netherlands, Altice purchased Suddenlink in December 2015 and Cablevision in June this year. The Altice USA division has 4.1 million broadband subscribers and 3.6 million pay-TV subscribers. Counting customers who subscribe to one or more services, Altice USA has 4.6 million customers in 20 states.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/us-broadband-still-no-isp-choice-for-many-especially-at-higher-speeds/">Cable dominates</a> the US broadband market, easily outperforming DSL networks that use old copper telephone lines. But fiber is generally even faster than cable, especially in upload speeds, so cable companies <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2016/02/comcast-2gbps-fiber-available-to-18m-homes-gigabit-cable-coming-soon/">including Comcast</a> have been building fiber-to-the-home in some areas.</p>

</div>Netflix today announced a feature many users have wanted for years—the ability to download videos and watch them later, without an Internet connection.
<p>"Netflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost," the company's <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/downloads-make-it-even-easier-to-watch-netflix-on-the-go">announcement said</a>. "While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their <em>Stranger Things</em> binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited." Downloads are available for all pricing plans.</p>
<p>The feature is available in the new versions of Netflix's apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&amp;hl=en">Android</a> devices. Not every show or movie is available for download, likely due to restrictions in programming contracts. Netflix says the download feature is available for "<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/54816">select TV shows and movies</a>." Besides <em>Stranger Things</em>, the Netflix announcement said that <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, <em>Narcos,</em> and <em>The Crown</em> are available for download now. These four have something in common: they are all produced by Netflix.</p>

<p><b>Update on 11/30/2016 2:20 PM California time:</b> Firefox developer Mozilla and Tor have <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/11/tor-releases-urgent-update-for-firefox-0day-thats-under-active-attack/">patched the underlying vulnerability</a>, which is found not only in the Windows version of the browser, but also the versions of Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>There's a zero-day exploit in the wild that's being used to execute malicious code on the computers of people using Tor and possibly other users of the Firefox browser, officials of the anonymity service confirmed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Word of the previously unknown Firefox vulnerability first surfaced in <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-November/042639.html">this post</a> on the official Tor website. It included several hundred lines of JavaScript and an introduction that warned: "This is an [sic] JavaScript exploit actively used against TorBrowser NOW." Tor cofounder Roger Dingledine <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-November/042640.html">quickly confirmed the previously unknown vulnerability</a> and said engineers from Mozilla were in the process of developing a patch.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T's DirecTV Now online streaming service goes live tomorrow, and the best pricing will only be available for a limited time. That's a problem, because the service is missing key features at launch and it's not clear when they'll arrive.</p>
<p>The biggest technical limitations might be the lack of recording functionality and the inability to pause live TV for more than a few seconds. DirecTV Now won't have DVR functionality until sometime next year, according to several news reports. If DVR launches in January or February, then it isn't such a huge deal, but if the functionality only comes late in 2017 that would dramatically reduce the value proposition for customers who sign up right away to lock in the most favorable pricing.</p>
<p>It's not even definite that DVR functionality will come to DirecTV Now in 2017. When contacted by Ars today, the company said that "DVR and pause capability is coming in the future, likely next year." (For customers' sake, we hope "likely next year" doesn't turn into "2018.")</p>

<figure class="intro-image intro-left"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MUNI-N-San-Francisco-1-800x600.jpg"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/MUNI-N-San-Francisco-1.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="3240" data-width="4320">Enlarge</a> (credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MUNI-N-San-Francisco-1.jpg">Zboralski</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>The attacker who infected servers and desktop computers at the San Francisco Metropolitan Transit Agency (SFMTA) with ransomware on November 25 apparently gained access to the agency's network by way of a known vulnerability in an Oracle WebLogic server. That vulnerability is similar to the one used to hack a Maryland hospital network's systems in April and infect multiple hospitals with crypto-ransomware. And evidence suggests that SFMTA wasn't specifically targeted by the attackers; the agency just came up as a target of opportunity through a vulnerability scan.</p>

<p>In an e-mail to Ars, SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose said that on November 25, "we became aware of a potential security issue with our computer systems, including e-mail." The ransomware "encrypted some systems mainly affecting computer workstations," he said, "as well as access to various systems. However, the SFMTA network was not breached from the outside, nor did hackers gain entry through our firewalls. Muni operations and safety were not affected. Our customer payment systems were not hacked. Also, despite media reports, no data was accessed from any of our servers."</p>
<p>That description of the ransomware attack is not consistent with some of the evidence of previous ransomware attacks by those behind the SFMTA incident—which Rose said primarily affected about 900 desktop computers throughout the agency. Based on communications uncovered from the ransomware operator behind the Muni attack published by <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/11/san-francisco-rail-system-hacker-hacked/">security reporter Brian Krebs</a>, an SFMTA Web-facing server was likely compromised by what is referred to as a "deserialization" attack after it was identified by a vulnerability scan.</p>

<p>It’s bizarre but true: wire recording is the longest-lasting capture format in audio history, one that paved the way for reel-to-reel tapes and a host of others—even though most people today, and some techies included, have barely heard of it.</p>
<p>Invented way back in 1898 and patented two years later, wire recording was somehow still getting some limited use as late as the early 1970s, while rockets took man to the moon on an annual basis. In its wake, vinyl, with its 67 years, and CD with a mere 33, look like footling youngsters. In its none-too-brief life, "the wire" also found use in Hollywood, provided a broadcast aid to spying, helped launch digital data capture, and pioneered the new art of bootlegging—sorry, "home recording."</p>
<p>Wire was longer-lasting in other ways too—whereas shellac and vinyl records would only last a few minutes per side, and the first commercial tape decks weren’t that much better, the wire recorder could get down over 60 minutes of audio.</p>

<p>When AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson last month <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/att-ceo-opponents-of-time-warner-merger-are-uninformed/">announced</a> a new DirecTV online video streaming service, he was clear about a few things: it would provide more than 100 channels, including "all the premium" channels customers want, and cost just $35 a month. As a result, AT&amp;T has gotten a lot of headlines about its $35, 100-channel streaming service over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But today we found out the full pricing details, and they're a bit less appealing than Stephenson's sales pitch. The offer of 100 channels for $35 is only good for customers who sign up when the service becomes available or shortly after that. Once the standard pricing sets in, new customers will pay $35 for 60 channels. The other standard packages are 80 channels for $50 a month, 100 channels for $60, and 120 channels for $70.</p>
<p>Premium channels HBO and Cinemax will cost an extra $5 a month in addition to the base price. The service will be available in the US only.</p>

<p>Online criminals—at least some of them wielding the notorious <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/inside-the-machine-uprising-how-cameras-dvrs-took-down-parts-of-the-internet/">Mirai</a> malware that transforms Internet-of-things devices into powerful denial-of-service cannons—have begun exploiting a critical flaw that may be present in millions of home routers.</p>
<p>Routers provided to German and Irish ISP customers for Deutsche Telekom and Eircom, respectively, have already been identified as being vulnerable, according to recently published reports from researchers tracking the attacks. The attacks exploit weaknesses found in routers made by Zyxel, Speedport, and possibly other manufacturers. The devices leave Internet port 7547 open to outside connections. The exploits use the opening to send commands based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069">TR-069</a> and related TR-064 protocols, which ISPs use to remotely manage large fleets of hardware. According to <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Port+7547+SOAP+Remote+Code+Execution+Attack+Against+DSL+Modems/21759">this advisory published Monday morning</a> by the SANS Internet Storm Center, honeypot servers posing as vulnerable routers are receiving exploits every five to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>SANS Dean of Research Johannes Ullrich said in Monday's post that exploits are almost certainly the cause behind an outage that hit Deutsche Telekom customers over the weekend. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/telekomhilft/photos/a.143615195685585.27512.122768271103611/1199966633383764/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook update</a>, officials with the German ISP said 900,000 customers are vulnerable to the attacks until they are rebooted and receive an emergency patch. Earlier this month, researchers at security firm BadCyber reported that the same one-two port 7547/TR-064 exploit hit the home router of a reader in Poland. They went on to identify D1000 routers supplied by Eircom as also being susceptible and <a href="https://devicereversing.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/eirs-d1000-modem-is-wide-open-to-being-hacked/">cited this post</a> as support. The Shodan search engine shows that 41 million devices leave port 7547 open, while about five million expose TR-064 services to the outside world.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks—and particularly over the retail adventure widely referred to as "Black Friday"—many Apple device owners experienced a new form of unsolicited and unwanted messages: a swarm of calendar alerts for online "deals" from spammers. The messages took advantage of the default settings in Apple's iCloud calendar service, allowing senders to automatically push calendar alerts to Apple iOS and macOS users and bypass e-mail entirely.</p>
<p>Getting rid of these calendar "invites" is a problem in itself, as declining them sends a message back to the spammer—confirming that someone actually is monitoring the iCloud account they targeted and encouraging them to send more messages. Getting rid of the unwanted alerts requires a multi-step workaround. But blocking them entirely only requires a single change to iCloud settings.</p>
<p>To get rid of the invites without sending a response to the spammer, you'll need to do the following:</p>

<p>The announcement at BlizzCon 2016 that met with the most muted response was arguably the most revolutionary.</p>
<p>While new content for the likes of <em>Hearthstone,</em> <em>Heroes of the Storm</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, and <em>Diablo III</em> drew appreciative roars from the Blizzard faithful, the news that <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2016/10/google-ai-neural-network-cryptography/">Google’s DeepMind</a> branch—which is dedicated to developing sophisticated Intelligence—would be teaming up with the makers of <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2015/11/starcraft-ii-legacy-of-the-void-review-your-last-best-chance/"><em>Starcraft 2</em></a> to further its research on AI elicited more of a murmur.</p>
<p>Perhaps the lack of enthusiasm was down to taste. After all, why would the plans of AI scientists be of interest to <em>Starcraft 2</em> players? As it turns out, if the collaboration between DeepMind and Blizzard is what its developers hope it could be, players will see very tangible benefits—and so will many others outside the video game space.</p>

(credit: Chris Evans)</p>  </figure><div><a name="page-1"></a></div>
<p>Recently released exploit code makes people running fully patched versions of Fedora and other Linux distributions vulnerable to drive-by attacks that can install keyloggers, backdoors, and other types of malware, a security researcher says.</p>
<p>One of the exploits—which targets a memory corruption vulnerability in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer">GStreamer framework</a> that by default ships with many mainstream Linux distributions—is also noteworthy for its elegance. To wit: it uses a rarely seen approach to defeat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">address space layout randomization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention">data execution prevention</a>, which are two of the security protections built in to Linux to make software exploits harder to carry out. ASLR randomizes the locations in computer memory where software loads specific chunks of code. As a result, code that exploits existing flaws often results in a simple computer crash rather than a catastrophic system compromise. Meanwhile, DEP, which is often referred to as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff966508(v=vs.85).aspx">NX or No-Execute</a>, blocks the execution of code that such exploits load into memory. (Ars Technology Editor Peter Bright has much more about ASLR and DEP <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/08/how-security-flaws-work-the-buffer-overflow/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Unlike most ASLR and DEP bypasses, the one folded into the GStreamer exploit doesn't rely on code to manipulate the memory layout or other environmental variables. Instead, it painstakingly arranges the bytes of code in a way that completely disables the protections. And by eliminating the need for JavaScript or other memory-massaging code to execute on a targeted computer, it's possible to carry out attacks that otherwise wouldn't be possible. Chris Evans, the security researcher who developed the exploit, describes the challenge as "a real beast."</p>

<p>AT&amp;T is disputing the Federal Communications Commission's allegation that it may be violating net neutrality rules by exempting DirecTV from wireless Internet data caps.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T purchased DirecTV in July 2015 and in September of this year started <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/att-owner-of-directv-exempts-directv-from-mobile-data-caps/">exempting DirecTV's online streaming</a> from the data caps. When other companies want to bypass data caps imposed on AT&amp;T customers, they have to pay AT&amp;T directly for an exemption.</p>
<p>The FCC has mostly allowed such zero-rating schemes to proceed, but this month the commission's wireless telecommunications bureau <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/att-zero-rating-of-directv-data-may-violate-net-neutrality-fcc-says/">told AT&amp;T that it may be violating net neutrality rules</a> and asked the carrier to respond to the concerns. AT&amp;T argued yesterday in a <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Quinn-cover-letter-on-zero-ratng.pdf">letter to the FCC</a> and an attached <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/White-paper-on-sponsored-data-Mon-PM.pdf">legal analysis</a> that the data cap exemption benefits consumers and is not a violation.</p>

<p>Microsoft is working on an emulator enabling systems with ARM processors to run x86 applications, according to sources speaking to <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-x86-on-arm64-emulation-a-windows-10-redstone-3-fall-2017-deliverable/">Mary Jo Foley</a>, and the capability will ship in the update codenamed "Redstone 3," currently due for fall 2017. This will be the third <em>Minecraft</em>-inspired Redstone codename; this year's Anniversary Update was Redstone 1, and the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/windows-10-creators-update-will-be-coming-for-free-this-spring/">Creators Update</a> coming in spring next year is Redstone 2.</p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft announced <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/02/windows-8-on-arm-building-a-common-windows-platform/">Windows on ARM</a> in 2012, there's been an immediate problem that prevents the port of the operating system from having mainstream appeal: it doesn't run Windows applications, because almost all Windows applications are compiled for x86 processors.</p>
<p>This isn't such a big deal for Windows on phones because phone applications have to be purpose-built to include a phone user interface, but it was one of the things that made Windows RT tablets, including Microsoft's own Surface, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/windows-rt-is-a-lemon-heres-how-microsoft-could-make-lemonade/">broadly undesirable</a>. And even while it isn't an issue for phone apps <em>per se</em>, it limits Microsoft's ambitions somewhat with Windows Mobile's Continuum feature. With Continuum, a Windows Mobile phone can connect to a keyboard, mouse, and screen, and the phone can run desktop-style applications. Currently, Continuum is limited to running UWP applications; these apps can offer dual user interfaces, adapting to whether being used in phone mode or Continuum mode. It would be logical and obvious to extend this to allow true Windows desktop applications to run in Continuum mode—but that raises the x86/ARM incompatibility issue once more.</p>

<p>Office Depot and its sister retailer OfficeMax have stopped using a technically dubious piece of malware-scanning software after two news services caught the stores recommending costly fixes for PC infections that didn't exist.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://jessejones.com/story/office-depot-insider-speaks-out/">investigation conducted by KIRO TV News</a>, four out of six stores in Seattle and Portland, Oregon claimed that out-of-the-box PCs showed "symptoms of malware" that required as much as $180 for repairs and protection. The computers, according to the report, had never been connected to the Internet and were diagnosed as free of malware by security firm IOActive. A separate TV News team from WFXT in Boston <a href="http://www.fox25boston.com/news/office-depot-suspends-pc-health-checks-after-fox25-investigation/468499682">reported on Friday</a> that the same free scanning service OfficeMax offers similarly misdiagnosed two of three brand-new PCs as potentially infected.</p>
<p>Officials at Office Depot, the parent company that operates both chains, said they are suspending use of software known as PC Health Check for scanning customers' computers for malware. The officials went on to say they didn't condone the conduct reported by the TV news organizations and have undertaken a review of the assertions.</p>
